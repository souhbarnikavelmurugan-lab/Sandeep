<h1>I want to say something from my heart…</h1>
<p class="subtitle">
Some feelings don’t appear suddenly — they grow quietly until they begin to feel like home.
</p>

<h2>To Sandeepkumar</h2>

<div class="letter">

Sandeepkumar,

The past few days were not easy for us. In my overwhelm I pushed you away, and I even said things about ending what we have. But my heart never truly meant it. I am sorry for hurting you.

What we share didn’t happen suddenly. It was built slowly — through years of friendship, patience, understanding, and all the little conversations only we know.

You have seen every version of me — the happy one, the quiet one, the confused one — and you still stayed. That means more to me than I can properly express.

Whenever everything inside me feels heavy and messy, I somehow find my way back to you. Talking to you steadies me and makes me feel like myself again.

Your presence calms me in a way nothing else does. No matter how far my thoughts wander, I return to you… because with you I feel safe, understood, and at peace.

I love you deeply, and I truly value us.

You are summer, full of light,
I was winter, cold as night.
You were the warmth I longed to feel,
While my heart stayed frozen, hard as steel.
You stood by me, patient and kind,
Melting the walls I tried to hide.
Now I soften where once I froze —
In your warmth, my heart glows.

</div>

<button onclick="yes()">I'm here ❤️</button>
<button onclick="no()">I need a moment…</button>

<div id="success">
Thank you for staying, for understanding me, and for being patient even when I struggled to understand myself.
I don’t promise a perfect love… but I promise a real one, where I choose you every day.
</div>
